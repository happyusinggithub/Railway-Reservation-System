        <ul id="perspectivelines">
            <li>The existing system is highly manually involving a lot of paper work and calculation and therefore may be enormous.This has lead to inconsistency and inaccuracy in maintaining of data.</li>
            
            <li>The data which is stored in paper only ,may be lost, stolen or destroyed due to natural calamities.</li>
            
            <li>Due to manual nature it is difficult to update,delete,add or view the data.</li>
